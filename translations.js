        writing_3: "On Mexico's Judicial Reform",
        writing_3_content: "<p><strong>Monterrey, June 1, 2025.</strong></p><p>As Mexicans, there is a gap that we all know regrettably well, a normalized and dangerously familiar void that seems to be a constant through the years and that fragments everything. This distance, apparently inescapable, between what we have traced in the laws that govern us and everyday reality, is one of the first disappointments that make up \"Mexicanity\".</p><p>This gap is called the Rule of Law, how much the laws represent reality, and the responsibility of closing that deep and painful gap falls on the institutions. That last word, of a grave (or plain) nature, which we have heard ad nauseam, perhaps has already been blurred in the common consciousness.</p><p>That is why I want to clarify that by institutions I do not refer to government buildings full of offices and adorned with patriotic symbols, but to the set of instruments that we have designed with the objective of making material that ideal that as a society we set out to pursue.</p><p>Thus, we can say that the task of institutions consists of bringing reality as close as possible to the ideal contained in the written norm; closing that gap.</p><p>This makes institutions an absolutely fundamental aspect of life in society. Therefore, if justice is one of our ideals, it is natural to ask ourselves what instruments we have built to ensure that this ideal materializes in the lives of everyone, and how we can make them more effective.</p><p>However, I warn that what is happening today has no relation to a genuine search to improve the justice institutions of our country and must be read in the light of the Mexican political context. As a result of a constitutional reform to the Judiciary, approved in record time and under the most reprehensible circumstances, an uncertain number of Mexicans will go to the polls with the objective of participating in a social experiment of unprecedented scale and implications.</p><p>Electing judges by popular vote implies the immediate and indiscriminate replacement of all justice operators and, in turn, eliminates the system of judicial career and balance of powers that, through competency exams and opposition contests, sought to ensure that the most prepared profiles occupied judicial positions.</p><p>Voting for judges is a terrible idea and, contrary to what one wants to believe, it is not a genuine democratic exercise, since there is no concrete accountability that can be requested from a Judge as it is requested from a governor or legislator. The Legislative and Executive powers can commit to a previously agreed result and campaign promises, however, justice cannot have partisan alliances or previous commitments that ensure a determined result, justice must be evaluated according to the particularities of each case and in the light of the most sensitive considerations.</p><p>What is happening today carries an enormous risk and does not represent any potential benefit, on the contrary, it opens the doors for characters with questionable alliances, unspeakable commitments and insufficient preparation to take the reins of one of the three powers of the union. Candidates linked to organized crime or illicitly supported by the same political characters they will have to judge, without judicial experience of any degree and \"cheat sheets\" distributed by political parties that, while titled \"in this election you decide\", proceed to indicate who to vote for. Undoubtedly, one of the most fundamental institutions of this country has been sold to the lowest bidders.</p><p>This new reality was built on two lies and an unfortunate truth. The first lie, that all judges are corrupt and their level of remuneration is immoral; the second lie, that replacing all judges through an election (carried out practically blindly) will solve our problems of injustice; and an unfortunate truth, that for a certain group of people the result of this election, that is, a weakened Rule of Law, is precisely the most beneficial scenario for their pretensions.</p><p>Persiste una importante e innegable desconexión entre los objetivos establecidos y ampliamente promocionados por los defensores de esta reforma, como eliminar la corrupción o incrementar la justicia, y los medios usados para alcanzarlos. Los propios instrumentos que se plantean para alcanzar estos objetivos están institucionalizando aspectos que contravienen abiertamente los principios de una mejor justicia, amplificando los problemas existentes e introduciendo nuevos problemas con implicaciones aún inciertas. Esto, me temo, es penosamente evidente. Por lo tanto, ha quedado claro que esta reforma desatiende (dolosamente) cualquiera de los problemas estructurales que pudieron haberse atendido de forma conjunta con las demás instituciones que conforman el sistema de justicia, entre ellas las fiscalías, a quienes no se ha modificado ningún aspecto y realizan la fundamental tarea de llevar a cabo las carpetas de investigación y acusaciones correspondientes.</p><p>This will not be an isolated event. We must remember that this judicial reform, also called \"Plan C\", was preluded by a couple of failed reforms (plans A and B) that were aimed at substantially modifying the country's electoral institutions (not those of justice). Said reforms were stopped by judicial instances, so it was evident to imagine what the next objective of these anti-democratic pretensions would be.</p><p>In turn, this reform comes in the context of the constant disappearance of autonomous bodies (such as the INAI and the IFT) to be replaced by the centralization of said powers in the Executive Branch. As if that were not enough, everything is framed in the context of the militarization of the country and the transfer of more and more powers to the armed forces. All this indicates a highly dangerous panorama, where the Rule of Law will be replaced by an authoritarianism based on the will of the political power in turn. I wish to be wrong and that time proves me otherwise.</p><p>The healthy division of powers, a fundamental pillar of democracy, is being broken, since the Legislative and Executive powers have the power to filter which people can be considered candidates for the Judiciary, ensuring that the approved profiles adjust to a political agenda (regardless of their background) and achieving that it is people grateful to political power who must serve as a democratic counterweight.</p><p>I fear that, with less prepared people occupying judicial positions, the improper use of artificial intelligence to issue sentences will gain dangerous relevance. It is highly viable to build systems trained to issue sentences based on pre-established biases, a question that violates the right of access to justice, but would facilitate masking the negative effects of the reform and simply dictating the sense of a ruling to a novice and inexperienced judge. It is true that this country is much bigger than all its crises, but it will take generations to repair what is being broken today.</p>",
        writing_4: "How Should the Judiciary Address the Use of Artificial Intelligence?",
        writing_4_content: "<p><strong>October 1, 2025.</strong></p><p>For just over two years, this question was part of my daily routine and, as a result, I helped develop one of the first strategies on the use of artificial intelligence from the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. This experience allowed me to confirm that the design and implementation of tools that leverage this technology involves understanding not only its deeply technical aspects, but also the transcendental questions that this tool poses about the responsibilities derived from its use and the nature of the human role in judicial work.</p><p>The current debate about its incorporation into the Judiciary is usually reduced to a choice between adopting it or maintaining the status quo. This discussion, however, has been largely constructed as a reaction to media events rather than from deep institutional reflection. Therefore, I consider this to be a limiting narrative. The discussion must be reoriented as soon as possible to define under what conditions, in what procedural areas, and with what control and accountability mechanisms it can be legitimately and effectively integrated into judicial work.</p><p>On the one hand, a total ban on its use in the judicial sphere would be practically impossible to implement and supervise, given the wide availability and accessibility of these models. On the other hand, the absence of clear institutional guidance on its use generates gray areas where discretionary conduct or even conduct contrary to the principles of transparency and accountability may arise.</p><p>Eventually, the Overton window regarding the use of artificial intelligence in governmental tasks will shift, and its adoption will become as common and necessary as the use of basic digital tools is today. With the purpose of contributing to the debate on the responsible use of artificial intelligence in the Supreme Court and in the Judiciary in general, I present below some reflections and guidelines that could serve as a guide toward proper implementation.</p><p>Regulate and make its use transparent. Transparency is a key value in all governmental exercise, one that must be observed daily. In this context, transparency around AI implies the development of a standardized and effectively communicated institutional policy on when, how and for what AI is allowed to be used in any judicial process, as well as what its limits are and prohibited zones from which administrative responsibilities could derive. An example of such regulation could cover the protection of personal data that naturally exists in legal documents and that could become part of training cycles for future models if they are not tested or if the option is not chosen (whenever possible) to leave this information outside the market of data susceptible to training. This would prevent highly sensitive information from ending up being exposed and referenced in subsequent conversations with other users.</p><p>Understand the unique nature of this technology. The technology being democratized today is fundamentally different from others that have revolutionized access to information. These models, when converted into agents with specific tasks, transform the information on which they have been trained into concrete actions that affect the real world; therefore, any bias, voluntary or not, can translate into decisions with real legal and social consequences. A model with a political inclination could issue a recommendation on a case with a more conservative or liberal perspective than another if an exercise of adaptation to legal analysis is not carried out.</p><p>In that sense, the Supreme Court possesses a vast amount of information that needs to be organized and structured in such a way that systems can access it, consult it, and process it to put it at the service of the Judiciary more efficiently. Large language models only function adequately when they have the correct information at the right time and if they are adequately trained to address different tasks.</p><p>Drive from institutional leadership. The responsible use of artificial intelligence in the judicial sphere requires institutional leadership capable of articulating a shared vision about the role this technology should play in the administration of justice. This implies rigorously analyzing how AI is currently being used, identifying which practices are effective and which must be corrected, as well as designing clear regulatory frameworks that govern its use and clarify responsibilities in the face of eventual abuses or failures.</p><p>While it has been rightly emphasized that artificial intelligence should not replace human reasoning, and I agree with that, I also believe we must move toward a reality in which sufficiently robust and transparent collaboration mechanisms can be designed to leverage technological capabilities without compromising judicial independence or the integrity of decisions. The leadership of the Supreme Court has the opportunity to institutionalize the use of these tools strategically, orienting their development toward efficiency, transparency, and the strengthening of the jurisdictional function.</p><p>A concrete example could be through the development of an AI trained specifically with the jurisprudential criteria of the High Court itself, which evaluates cases and generates a preliminary report that will be made available to judges on whether the case merits special attention and application of gender perspective criteria or the observance of the duty of prior consultation with people with disabilities, indigenous peoples and communities, among other historically vulnerable groups. Essentially, it would determine—based on the applicable criteria of the court itself—whether the case requires a reinforced analytical perspective and would suggest a course of action without at any time replacing the judgment of the judges or interfering with their independence.</p><p>If the SCJN manages to channel artificial intelligence under the principles that have historically defined it—ethics, legal rigor, and commitment to human rights—it will not only set a precedent in Mexico, but also an international reference on how technology can serve the Law without subordinating it.</p>",

        writing_3_content: '<p><strong>Monterrey, 1 de Junio de 2025.</strong></p><p>Como mexicanas y mexicanos existe una brecha que todas y todos conocemos lamentablemente bien, un hueco normalizado y peligrosamente familiar que parece ser una constante a través de los años y que lo fragmenta todo. Esta distancia, aparentemente ineludible, entre lo que hemos trazado en las leyes que nos rigen y la realidad cotidiana, es una de las primeras decepciones que conforman la mexicanidad.</p><p>A esta brecha se le llama el Estado de Derecho, qué tanto las leyes representan la realidad, y la responsabilidad de cerrar esa profunda y dolorosa brecha recae en las instituciones. Esa última palabra, de naturaleza grave (o llana), que hemos escuchado hasta el cansancio, quizá ya se ha desdibujado en la consciencia común.</p><p>Por eso quiero aclarar que por instituciones no me refiero a edificios gubernamentales repletos de oficinas y adornados con símbolos patrios, sino al conjunto de instrumentos que hemos diseñado con el objetivo de hacer material aquél ideal que como sociedad nos dispusimos perseguir.</p><p>Es así, que podemos decir que la tarea de las instituciones consiste en acercar lo más posible la realidad al ideal contenido en la norma escrita; cerrar esa brecha.</p><p>Esto convierte a las instituciones en un aspecto absolutamente fundamental de la vida en sociedad. Por lo tanto, si la justicia es uno de nuestros ideales, es natural preguntarnos qué instrumentos hemos construido para procurar que ese ideal se materialice en la vida de todas y todos, y cómo podemos hacerlos más efectivos.</p><p>Sin embargo, advierto que lo que hoy sucede no tiene ninguna relación con una genuina búsqueda de mejorar las instituciones de justicia de nuestro país y debe leerse a la luz del contexto político mexicano. Como resultado de una reforma constitucional al Poder Judicial, aprobada en tiempo récord y bajo las circunstancias más reprobables, un número incierto de mexicanas y mexicanos saldrán a las urnas con el objetivo de participar en un experimento social de escala e implicaciones sin precedentes.</p><p>Elegir a las personas juzgadoras mediante voto popular supone el reemplazo inmediato e indiscriminado de todas y todos los operadores de justicia y, a su vez, elimina el sistema de carrera judicial y balance de poderes que, a través de exámenes de competencia y concursos de oposición, procuraba que los perfiles más preparados ocuparan los cargos judiciales.</p><p>Votar por las personas juzgadoras es una pésima idea y, contrario a lo que se quiere creer, no es un ejercicio democrático genuino, pues no existe una concreta rendición de cuentas que se le pueda solicitar a un Juez como se le solicita a un gobernador o legislador. Los poderes Legislativo y Ejecutivo pueden comprometerse a un resultado previamente acordado y promesas de campaña, sin embargo, la justicia no puede tener alianzas partidistas ni compromisos previos que aseguren un resultado determinado, la justicia debe evaluarse conforme las particularidades de cada caso y a la luz de las consideraciones más sensibles.</p><p>Lo que sucede hoy conlleva un enorme riesgo y no representa ningún beneficio potencial, al contrario, abre las puertas a que personajes con alianzas cuestionables, compromisos inconfesables y preparación insuficiente tomen las riendas de uno de los tres poderes de la unión. Candidatos ligados al crimen organizado o apoyados de manera ilícita por los mismos personajes políticos que deberán juzgar, sin experiencia judicial de ningún grado y acordeones distribuidos por partidos políticos que, mientras llevan por título \"en esta elección tú decides\", proceden a indicarte por quién votar. Sin duda se ha vendido una de las instituciones más fundamentales de este país a los postores más bajos.</p><p>Esta nueva realidad se construyó a partir de dos mentiras y una verdad desafortunada. La primera mentira, que todas las personas juzgadoras son corruptas y su nivel de remuneración es inmoral; la segunda mentira, que reemplazar a todas las personas juzgadoras mediante una elección (realizada prácticamente a ciegas) resolverá nuestros problemas de injusticia; y una desafortunada verdad, que para cierto grupo de personas el resultado de esta elección, es decir un Estado de Derecho debilitado, es precisamente el escenario más beneficioso para sus pretensiones.</p><p>Persiste una importante e innegable desconexión entre los objetivos establecidos y ampliamente promocionados por los defensores de esta reforma, como eliminar la corrupción o incrementar la justicia, y los medios usados para alcanzarlos. Los propios instrumentos que se plantean para alcanzar estos objetivos están institucionalizando aspectos que contravienen abiertamente los principios de una mejor justicia, amplificando los problemas existentes e introduciendo nuevos problemas con implicaciones aún inciertas. Esto, me temo, es penosamente evidente. Por lo tanto, ha quedado claro que esta reforma desatiende (dolosamente) cualquiera de los problemas estructurales que pudieron haberse atendido de forma conjunta con las demás instituciones que conforman el sistema de justicia, entre ellas las fiscalías, a quienes no se ha modificado ningún aspecto y realizan la fundamental tarea de llevar a cabo las carpetas de investigación y acusaciones correspondientes.</p><p>Este no será un evento aislado. Debemos recordar que esta reforma judicial, también llamada \"Plan C\", estuvo preludiada por un par de reformas fallidas (los planes A y B) que estaban encaminadas a modificar sustancialmente las instituciones electorales del país (no así las de justicia). Dichas reformas fueron detenidas por las instancias judiciales, por lo que resultaba evidente imaginar cuál sería el siguiente objetivo de estas pretensiones antidemocráticas.</p><p>A su vez, esta reforma viene en el contexto de la constante desaparición de organismos autónomos (como el INAI y el IFT) para ser reemplazados por la centralización de dichas facultades en el Poder Ejecutivo. Por si fuera poco, todo se enmarca en el contexto de la militarización del país y de la transferencia de cada vez más facultades a las fuerzas armadas. Todo esto nos indica un panorama sumamente peligroso, en donde el Estado de Derecho será reemplazado por un autoritarismo basado en la voluntad del poder político en turno. Deseo estar equivocado y que el tiempo me demuestre lo contrario.</p><p>Se está rompiendo con la sana división de poderes, un pilar fundamental de la democracia, pues los poderes Legislativo y Ejecutivo tienen el poder de filtrar qué personas pueden ser consideradas candidatas al Poder Judicial, asegurando que los perfiles aprobados se ajusten a una agenda política (sin importar sus antecedentes) y logrando que sean personas agradecidas con el poder político quienes deban fungir como un contrapeso democrático.</p><p>Me temo que, con personas menos preparadas ocupando los cargos judiciales, el uso indebido de la inteligencia artificial para emitir sentencias cobrará una peligrosa relevancia. Es sumamente viable construir sistemas entrenados para emitir sentencias a partir de sesgos preestablecidos, una cuestión que viola el derecho de acceso a la justicia, pero facilitaría enmascarar los efectos negativos de la reforma y dictar de forma sencilla el sentido de un fallo a un juez novato e inexperto. Es cierto que este país es mucho más grande que todas sus crisis, pero tomará generaciones reparar lo que hoy se está rompiendo.</p>',
        writing_4: "¿Cómo Debe el Poder Judicial Abordar el Uso de Inteligencia Artificial?",
        writing_4_content: '<p><strong>1 de Octubre de 2025.</strong></p><p>Durante poco más de dos años, esta pregunta formó parte de mi día a día y, como resultado, ayudé a desarrollar una de las primeras estrategias sobre el uso de inteligencia artificial desde la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación. Esta experiencia me permitió constatar que el diseño e implementación de herramientas que aprovechan esta tecnología implica comprender no solo sus aspectos profundamente técnicos, sino también las preguntas trascendentales que esta herramienta nos plantea sobre las responsabilidades que de su uso derivan y la naturaleza del rol humano en la tarea judicial.</p><p>El debate actual sobre su incorporación al Poder Judicial suele reducirse a una elección entre adoptarla o mantener el status quo. Esta discusión, sin embargo, ha sido construida en gran medida como una reacción a eventos mediáticos más que a partir de una reflexión institucional profunda. Por lo tanto, considero que esta es una narrativa limitante. La discusión debe reorientarse lo antes posible para definir bajo qué condiciones, en qué ámbitos procesales y con qué mecanismos de control y rendición de cuentas puede integrarse de forma legítima y efectiva en el quehacer judicial.</p><p>Por un lado, una prohibición total de su uso en el ámbito judicial sería prácticamente imposible de implementar y supervisar, dada la amplia disponibilidad y accesibilidad de estos modelos. Por otro lado, la ausencia de una guía institucional clara sobre su uso genera zonas grises donde pueden surgir conductas discrecionales o incluso contrarias a los principios de transparencia y rendición de cuentas.</p><p>Eventualmente, la ventana de Overton respecto al uso de inteligencia artificial en las tareas gubernamentales se desplazará, y su adopción se volverá tan común y necesaria como hoy lo es el uso de herramientas digitales básicas. Con el propósito de contribuir al debate sobre el uso responsable de la inteligencia artificial en la Suprema Corte y en el Poder Judicial en general, expongo a continuación algunas reflexiones y lineamientos que podrían servir de guía hacia una adecuada implementación.</p><p>Reglamentar y transparentar su uso. La transparencia es un valor clave en todo ejercicio gubernamental, uno que debe observarse diariamente. En este contexto, la transparencia en torno a la IA implica el desarrollo de una política institucional homologada y efectivamente comunicada sobre cuándo, cómo y para qué se permite el uso de la IA en cualquier proceso judicial, así como cuáles son sus límites y zonas prohibidas sobre las que podrían derivarse responsabilidades administrativas. Un ejemplo de tal reglamentación podría cubrir la protección de datos personales que naturalmente se encuentran en documentos jurídicos y que podrían formar parte de ciclos de entrenamientos de futuros modelos si no son testados o si no se opta (siempre que sea posible) por dejar esta información fuera del mercado de datos susceptibles de entrenamiento. Esto evitaría que información sumamente delicada terminara siendo expuesta y referenciada en conversaciones posteriores con otros usuarios.</p><p>Comprender la naturaleza única de esta tecnología. La tecnología que hoy se está democratizando es fundamentalmente distinta a otras que han revolucionado el acceso a la información. Estos modelos, cuando son convertidos en agentes con tareas específicas, transforman la información sobre la que han sido entrenados en acciones concretas que afectan el mundo real, por lo tanto, cualquier sesgo, voluntario o no, puede traducirse en decisiones con consecuencias jurídicas y sociales reales. Un modelo con una inclinación política podría dar emitir una recomendación sobre algún caso con una perspectiva más conservadora o liberal que otro si no se realiza un ejercicio de adecuación al análisis jurídico</p><p>En ese sentido, la Suprema Corte posee una vasta cantidad información que necesitan ser organizada y estructurada de manera tal que los sistemas puedan accederla, consultarla y procesarla para ponerla al servicio del Poder Judicial de manera más eficiente. Los modelos de lenguaje de gran tamaño solo funcionan de manera adecuada cuando tienen la información correcta en el momento indicado y si son entrenados de manera adecuada para atender diferentes tareas.</p><p>Impulsar desde el liderazgo institucional. El aprovechamiento responsable de la inteligencia artificial en el ámbito judicial requiere un liderazgo institucional capaz de articular una visión compartida sobre el papel que esta tecnología debe desempeñar en la administración de justicia. Ello implica analizar con rigor cómo se está utilizando actualmente la IA, identificar qué prácticas resultan efectivas y cuáles deben corregirse, así como diseñar marcos normativos claros que regulen su uso y aclaren responsabilidades ante eventuales abusos o fallas.</p><p>Si bien se ha enfatizado con razón que la inteligencia artificial no debe sustituir el razonamiento humano, y en ello estoy de acuerdo, también creo que debemos caminar hacia una realidad en la que puedan diseñarse mecanismos de colaboración suficientemente robustos y transparentes para aprovechar las capacidades tecnológicas sin comprometer la independencia judicial ni la integridad de las decisiones. El liderazgo de la Suprema Corte tiene la oportunidad de institucionalizar el uso de estas herramientas de forma estratégica, orientando su desarrollo hacia la eficiencia, la transparencia y el fortalecimiento de la función jurisdiccional.</p><p>Un ejemplo concreto podría ser mediante el desarrollo de una IA entrenada específicamente con los criterios jurisprudenciales del propio Alto Tribunal, que evalúe casos y genere un reporte preliminar que será puesto a disposición de las personas juzgadoras sobre si el caso amerita la especial atención y aplicación de criterios de perspectiva de género o la observancia del deber de consulta previa a personas con discapacidad, pueblos y comunidades indígenas, entre otros grupos históricamente vulnerados. Esencialmente, determinaría —con base en los criterios aplicables del propio tribunal— si el caso exige una perspectiva reforzada de análisis y sugeriría una ruta de acción sin sustituir en ningún momento el juicio de las personas juzgadoras ni interferir con su independencia.</p><p>Si la SCJN logra encauzar la inteligencia artificial bajo los principios que la han definido históricamente —ética, rigor jurídico y compromiso con los derechos humanos—, no solo marcará un precedente en México, sino también un referente internacional sobre cómo la tecnología puede servir al Derecho sin subordinarlo.</p>',

        project_solomon_desc: "<p>El proyecto Sor Juana, que comenzó bajo el nombre clave Solomon, es la primera aplicación de Inteligencia Artificial (IA) desarrollada por la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN). Estuve a cargo de diseñar y programar esta primera aplicación de IA de la Corte, y de desarrollar su estrategia de Modelos de Lenguaje de Gran Tamaño (LLM) a través del proyecto.</p><p>Este trabajo revolucionó el acceso a los documentos de la Suprema Corte, facilitando la revisión, comprensión y socialización de las versiones públicas de las sentencias.</p><p>La plataforma ha demostrado una eficiencia significativa. El proyecto ha procesado cientos de sentencias y, hasta diciembre de 2024, fue consultado por más de 20,000 personas, resolviendo miles de preguntas a través de su chatbot de consulta.</p><p>La relevancia del proyecto trascendió las fronteras, lo que me llevó a presentarlo en la Universidad de Stanford. Tuve la oportunidad de exponer el proyecto 'Sor Juana' en el prestigioso Stanford Legal Design Lab, un foro centrado en la Inteligencia Artificial y el Acceso a la Justicia. Adicionalmente, presenté la filosofía (ethos) y los resultados del proyecto en el encuentro Stanford CodeX, uno de los centros de tecnología legal más importantes a nivel global.</p>",
